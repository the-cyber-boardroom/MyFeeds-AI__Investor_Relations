# MyFeeds.AI Pitch Deck Generation Brief for LLM
## Complete Instructions for Creating Light & Comprehensive Pitch Decks

---

# PART 1: CONTEXT & BEST PRACTICES

## Company Overview
**MyFeeds.AI** is a GenAI-powered personalized news platform initially focused on cybersecurity, founded by serial entrepreneur Dinis Cruz (successful exit, running multiple startups) in Portugal. The company uses semantic knowledge graphs and LLMs to solve information overload for security executives and professionals.

## Key Success Factors from Top Angel/VC Pitches
Based on analysis of successful raises from companies like Airbnb, Uber, Front, Buffer, and Canva:

### Critical Design Principles
1. **Hook in 7 seconds**: The cover slide must instantly communicate the value proposition
2. **Story over data**: Lead with narrative, support with metrics
3. **Visual > Text**: Use infographics, icons, and diagrams (80% visual, 20% text)
4. **One message per slide**: Each slide should have ONE clear takeaway
5. **Progressive disclosure**: Build complexity gradually
6. **Emotional connection**: Make investors feel the pain before showing the solution
7. **Social proof early**: Credibility markers on every slide
8. **Clear ask**: Specific amount, use of funds, and expected outcomes

### Proven Slide Flow Pattern
1. **Problem** (emotional hook) → 
2. **Solution** (simple explanation) → 
3. **Market** (TAM/SAM/SOM) → 
4. **Product** (demo/proof) → 
5. **Traction** (validation) → 
6. **Business Model** (unit economics) → 
7. **Competition** (positioning) → 
8. **Team** (credibility) → 
9. **Ask** (specific needs) → 
10. **Vision** (big picture future)
